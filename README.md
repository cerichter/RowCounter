# RowCounter

This is a IOS tool to keep track of the current (or completed) rows in a crochet, kitting, or any other row based craft project. It includes a bar to show the amount of time that has elapsed since the last update so that when you inevitably think, "Did I press the button or not?", you can reassure yourself at a glance. 

Other features include the ability to add upwards of five trackers and to name them individually for easy identification.
